ERROR NOTES:

The following version of the project is still not working. At runtime the following error code is given
 during the neural network initialization:

***Unexpected BusFault @ 0x08000520
Fault caused by attempted access to 0x8ff0e8bd

The suspicion is that the array of unsigned 8-bit integers s_network_weights[ 130064 ] in the file network_data.h 
is too large to fit into the MCU flash. The error is launched during the "ai_platform_network_init()" function call
of the network_runtime.a library, located in the function "ai_network_init()" in the network.c source file.

network.c: ai_module/Middlewares/ST/AI/AI/src/
network_data.c: ai_module/Middlewares/ST/AI/AI/data/

Another potential source of error could be the Makefile, some C_FLAGS for the gcc compiler had to be added from
the one generated by the STM32CubeMX tool.
